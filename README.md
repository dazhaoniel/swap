Solazo Weather App (SWAp)
=========================

[Website](http://solazo.org)

Solazo is a weather app that helps to give you an approximation of current weather condition in your area. Solazo is not a stand-alone weather app, but instead Solazo is a resource that can help introduce an additional level of precision in your weather request. Weather apps rely on weather stations to gauge current conditions. If you are located far from a weather station, or at a much higher elevation, you can often get unreliable or inconsistent results. Solazo uses a mashup of various weather APIs, historical data, Crowdsourced data and a little math to give you an approximation of conditions in your exact geolocation. 

Solazo is a big believer in Participatory Sensing and Citizen Science. We rely heavily on the data of your personal weather stations. So please submit whatever information you may have, where ever you may be, when ever you can.
